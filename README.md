# Vanilla CSS

Vanilla CSS is a fast, lightweight, cross-platform CSS framework for building incredible, powerful web applications.

## Introduction

The Vanilla CSS team maintains every byte of code in the framework and works hard each day to make sure it is small and intuitive. Who's using Vanilla CSS? Glad you asked! Here are a few:

* Facebook
* Google
* YouTube
* Yahoo
* Wikipedia
* Windows Live
* Twitter
* Amazon
* LinkedIn
* MSN
* eBay
* Microsoft

In fact, Vanilla CSS is already used on more websites than Bootstrap, Foundation, Gumby, Blueprint, and 960gs - combined.

## Getting Started

The Vanilla CSS team takes pride in the fact that it is the most lightweight framework available anywhere; using our production-quality deployment strategy, your users' browsers will have Vanilla CSS loaded into memory before it even requests your site.

To use Vanilla CSS, just put the following code anywhere in your application's HTML:

<link src="path/to/vanilla.css" rel="stylesheet">

That's right - no code at all. Vanilla CSS is so popular that browsers have been automatically loading it for over a decade.
